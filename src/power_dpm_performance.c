/**
 * Referring to the linux kernel we can set various
 * parameters in the power_dpm_force_performance_level node.

 * 
 * DOC: power_dpm_force_performance_level
 *
 * The amdgpu driver provides a sysfs API for adjusting certain power
 * related parameters.  The file power_dpm_force_performance_level is
 * used for this.  It accepts the following arguments:
 *
 * - auto
 *
 * - low
 *
 * - high
 *
 * - manual
 *
 * - profile_standard
 *
 * - profile_min_sclk
 *
 * - profile_min_mclk
 *
 * - profile_peak
 *
 * auto
 *
 * When auto is selected, the driver will attempt to dynamically select
 * the optimal power profile for current conditions in the driver.
 *
 * low
 *
 * When low is selected, the clocks are forced to the lowest power state.
 *
 * high
 *
 * When high is selected, the clocks are forced to the highest power state.
 *
 * manual
 *
 * When manual is selected, the user can manually adjust which power states
 * are enabled for each clock domain via the sysfs pp_dpm_mclk, pp_dpm_sclk,
 * and pp_dpm_pcie files and adjust the power state transition heuristics
 * via the pp_power_profile_mode sysfs file.
 *
 * profile_standard
 * profile_min_sclk
 * profile_min_mclk
 * profile_peak
 *
 * When the profiling modes are selected, clock and power gating are
 * disabled and the clocks are set for different profiling cases. This
 * mode is recommended for profiling specific work loads where you do
 * not want clock or power gating for clock fluctuation to interfere
 * with your results. profile_standard sets the clocks to a fixed clock
 * level which varies from asic to asic.  profile_min_sclk forces the sclk
 * to the lowest level.  profile_min_mclk forces the mclk to the lowest level.
 * profile_peak sets all clocks (mclk, sclk, pcie) to the highest levels.
